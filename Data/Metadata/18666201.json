These font are usually created with black line with appearance of three dimensionality.  \"W\" with fifteen degree ellipses on ends at upper left with half of letter filled with black which is labelled \"Half Full\" below.  Large partial fifteen degree ellipse in black line drawing with much smaller fifteen degree ellipse perpendicular at top center.   Letter \"I\" which is \"half full\" at upper right with with cowboy hat motif as top. Various letters such as \"D, J, X, W, g, k\" in \"Outwest\" font are scattered throughout poster. Orange text box (7 1/2 x 19) with name of font and color photo reproduction of desert landscape, typical of West.  It shows electric pole along dirt road with mountain range in background and arid land in foreground all in brownish tones. Same photo at bottom left but smaller in size and upside down.  Vertical orange text box at center right which shows five variations of this font using letter \"h\": plain white font without outline is \"bold\", black outlined font is \"light\", combination of bold and light, bottom part of font filled in with black is \"half full\", and top part of font filled in with black  is \"top full\". Below center, two part orange irregular shape made from curvature with partial visible \"emigre\" logo and large \"W\" in \"light\" font to right.  Superimposed on this shape,\"W\", and white background is text thus only parts overlapping color background can be seen. Play on postive and negative. Emigre logo, black slanted ellipse with \"EMIGRE\" in white, at center along bottom edge.",
