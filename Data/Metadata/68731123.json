The exhibition focused on the relationship between fashion and cinema.  For their poster design, the team chose a graphic word play on the phrase Out of Fashion by adding additional or alternate prepositions, including Up, In, On and Of.  The designers drew inspiration from the title of the film by William Klein “In and Out of Fashion.”  Tying the composition together, Experiemental Jetset generated a layer of dots that recalls both textile patterns and the grainy resolution of film and video screens.",

In the middle of the composition, the words \"OF/FASHION\" span the two columns. The white ground is printed with a grid of small dots. The poster was designed to advertise an exhibition at NAiM / Bureau Europa.",
