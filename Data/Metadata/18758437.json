        "gallery_text": "Norwegian-born graphic designer and publisher Lars Müller was commissioned with the design of this poster, advertising a retrospective exhibition of Bruno Munari – influential Italian artist and designer – held at the Museum für Gestaltung in Zurich, Switzerland. Munari’s work was strongly influenced by the futurist movement, which he officially adhered to in 1927. Several of his works also owe much to surrealism, probably discovered after meeting with André Breton and Louis Aragon in Paris during the 1930’s. Müller pays homage to the artist by using a series of minimal, curving red lines and circular holes, which evoke Munari’s graphic transformations of everyday objects into abstract artworks, saturated with philosophical connotations. Bruno Munari is little known outside of Italy, a situation inversely proportional to his importance in the world of design.",
