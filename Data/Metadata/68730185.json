The English language translation of the exhibition title is quite different from the literal translation of the Korean title, which means “Whatever happened to the theme park.”  Sulki & Min were interested in incorporating the idea of porosity and transparency into their poster design, drawing on Modernist references: Gerd Arntz’s human figures for the Isotype system are laid out across the background of the poster, while the letterforms are derived from Josef Albers.  Each element is treated with a graphic mind towards translucence, so that the buildup of layers maintains a sense of airy space evocative of the exhibition's theme.",

The words are printed in varying shades of blue, with different textures (lined, dotted, etc.). They are integrated into a larger composition of abstract designs (yellow and purple) and Hangul text (red), as if in layers. Beneath these layers, small human figures are lightly outlined against the white background. They are shown in various poses of relaxation and play.",
