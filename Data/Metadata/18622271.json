The purpose of the campaign was to present the possible consequences if military personnel did not mind with whom, or where, they were discussing military tactics. “A Careless Word…A Needless Sinking” is meant to show the repercussions of “loose lips”, so to speak, because one was never sure when the enemy was nearby, or who the enemy might be.",
