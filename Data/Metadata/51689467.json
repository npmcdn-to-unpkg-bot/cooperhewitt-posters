Scher designed an identity using a typographic family of slab serifs, setting the typography over photographer Lois Greenfield’s images of the dancers. The following year, Scher reinvented the identity at Feld’s request, staggering the letterforms to make them appear as though they were moving in space. Feld provided Scher with different images from his company for Scher to incorporate into her designs. \nIn this poster for Ballet Tech’s 1999 season, Scher incorporates photographic images of four female dancers in identical elongated positions and sets them against a background of the lighting design plan used for the company's performances at the Joyce Theater in New York City.",
