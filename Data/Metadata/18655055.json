        "gallery_text": "The number of refugees rapidly increased at the start of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). Among these refugees were thousands of children-- some of whom endured wartime Spain, while others evacuated to other European countries. This poster most likely depicts one of Spain’s government funded residencias, residences, that promoted protection and care for refugee children. The Ministry of Public Education and Health and the National Council for Evacuated Children of Spain oversaw the management of these residences, where women often educated the children. The woman depicted in the poster represents the motherly care provided to children at the residences. What is more, children were educated about Republican values with the idea that they were to grow up as working adults in the agricultural and industrial unions forming in Spain at the time. In the effort of promoting a nationalistic agenda, not only did these residences provide a special refuge for children, but the housing program also educated them to become the future of Republican Spain.",
