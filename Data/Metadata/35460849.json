Philippe Apeloig, along with six other graphic design studios, was commissioned to produce a poster that employed the grid structure Crouwel devised for his now iconic Stedelijk Museum posters. \nApeloig drew from his experience as an intern in the 1980s at Crouwel’s firm, Total Design, to design the poster. He utilizes the framework of the grid itself and a simple color palette to create the text. Both the grid and reduced color palette are a tribute to Crouwel’s signature graphic design style. For this poster, Apeloig uses the grid to create text that appears to glide playfully all over the page, with black text punctuated by white dots emphasizing the diagonal pull of each word against the strict axis of the grid.",
