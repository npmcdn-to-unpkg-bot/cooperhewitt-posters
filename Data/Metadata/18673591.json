These words and the boxes that contain them are printed in alternating black, pink and blue and are connected across the image by thin black lines. Top section of sheet is divided in brown at left and blue-green at right with text block reading \"cranbrook\" at upper left corner and \"graduate\" at upper right.  The sheet is dominated top to bottom by text in different fonts arranged on a center justification.",
