Rockefeller of the Office of Inter-American Affairs to create posters for Latin America. The purpose of these posters was to persuade Latin American opinion against the Axis powers of WWII, in order to increase solidarity of the Western hemisphere. The image of the white Latin cross represents the Freedom of Religion, one of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four freedoms, stated to the United States Congress in January, 1941.",
