To represent the multimedia exhibition, they designed a symbol of artistic transformation. Felix Pfäffli describes the poster’s enormous squiggle as the first stroke of the artist, which begins in the lower left as spray paint, before morphing into paper, then plastic, and then changing back to its original form in the top right. For designers in the digital age, media is endlessly malleable—a simple click can transform textures and materials. The squiggle is itself subject to digital transformation. Using design software, the Pfäfflis simulated shadows and highlights, giving it the appearance of dimensionality. Printed in bright red, their squiggle is volumetric and a bit voluptuous. As Pfäffli explains, \"A brushstroke isn’t just a stroke anymore. It can be whatever you want.\"",
