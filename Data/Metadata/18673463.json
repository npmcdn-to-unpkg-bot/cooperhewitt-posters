Because it will have / different aspects and thoughts, like: Why we made typography / in my typography classes at the end of the 60ies so and / not so like many others.  Why we see typography not like Ruder, / why we came automatically to the transparency of filmmaterials, and / how we work with this material.  What are my teaching / principles. How I make a poster (will show on an example with overheadprojector). What can be the future of typography. / What we are doing now on the Computer (Mac).  For what can be / this Computer needful.  Why we keep our lead-typeshop / for ever.  Why we have so many American students or from other / countries.  Is our teaching method the wright [sic] method for / the practice.  What is the difference of our school-philosophy / from other schools........ and so on... But we have annyway [sic] only a little bit more than 60 minutes and than [sic] gets mostly / annyway [sic] boring. Do you plan a discussion? / I send you a list what I need for the presentation and in- / formation about myself. If you need more information please let / me know. /  With many greetings, / always-[signature]\nVerso: in black, upper left quadrant, return address for AIGA and Non Profit Postage Permit",
