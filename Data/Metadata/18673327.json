It is / estimated that only14 percent of solar / radiation will be transmitted as against / 90 percent by conventional glass, and / this will markedly decrease the solar / heat entering the building.\n3rd paragraph: The portion of the building that Citicorp / will occupy will feature newly developed / lighting fixtures that will reduce the / amount of energy required for illumination. / These fixtures will be single tube fluores- / cents with reflectors that will transmit a / higher percentage of light than is normal / from a standard fluorescent fixture.\n4th paragraph: In addition, Citicorp Center will use a spe- / cial system of air filters which will permit / the reuse of air generated by the heating / and cooling units. This will reduce the / intake of outside air, diminishing the need / to cool or heat new air coming into the / building. / Moreover, the air inside the build- / ing will be cleaner because it will be sub- / stantially free of pollutants.",
