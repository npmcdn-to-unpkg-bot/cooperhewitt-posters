        "gallery_text": "“Someone Talked!” was submitted to a poster competition geared toward highlighting the urgency of national security. This type of poster was a response to the numerous ships that were being sunk off U.S. coasts during WWII. “Someone Talked”, and posters like it, were commonly displayed at shipyards, army and navy posts, and waterfront bars because they were seen as being susceptible to spies. These posters acted as a warning to military personnel of the consequences of divulging military plans regardless of an overwhelming American military presence.",
