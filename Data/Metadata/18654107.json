These horrors/  although shroudded in secrecy throughout his lifetime, and by/ his principal biographers, are confirmed in a series of letters/ and diary entries dound, long after his death, under a floor/ board in his study. After marrying effie Gray, who was/ born in the room in which Ruskin's grandfather had/ committed suicide, he declared her \"unfit for con-/ sumation\", adding that he would reconsider when/ she reached the age of twenty-five (he was/ twenty-eight and she was nineteen), six/ years later, on her twenty-fifth birthday,/ Rushkin had still not reckoned with his/ legendary disdain for pubic hair, and told/ her that she was still unfit, citing religious reasons for his abstention.  Quite/ shortly after, the marriage was annulled and Effie was remarried to the Pre-/ Raphaelite painter, John Millais.\"",
