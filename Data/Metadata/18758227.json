        "gallery_text": "Using collage to play with scale, Andrzej Klimowski creates surreal imagery in this movie poster. Photographs are enlarged, cut, and layered; text is rotated and placed vertically. The result is disorientating — the poster appears to condense scenes (disrupting the plot line) with spectacular effect. Early twentieth-century photo-collagists have been influential on Klimowski’s work,  but the designer has developed a signature style that combines elements from Surrealism, Dadaism, and Expressionism together with his own process.",
