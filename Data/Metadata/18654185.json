        "gallery_text": "New York-based graphic designer Michael Bierut created this poster for the Designing New York Committee’s Save Our City event in 1991, while a new partner at Pentagram (he joined the firm’s New York office the year before). The black and white poster promotes and commemorates a symposium on how design might improve residents’ experience of living in the city.  This high-contrast piece shows Bierut’s expertise in manipulating type. The top half of the poster is black and phrases in white block capitals are turned on their side to evoke Manhattan’s skyscrapers seen from a distance. “Save Our City” is printed in black type of varying sizes with only the bottom portion of the word “save” is seen; it blends with the swath of black from above, conjuring a sinking feeling, or of being consumed by the environment. Bierut is a master of utilizing optical tricks to convey his concepts graphically. He designs for his audience,  and is careful to consider the most direct way of relating information to those who will receive it.",
