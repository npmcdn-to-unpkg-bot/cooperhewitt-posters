Text reads: \" ACRHIS No. 8, '89/ \"I Believe that all great architects have failed./ Their work serves as an example precisely because it/ has failed.  That is why modernity is still living; as/ a failture, not as a success.\"/ DANIEL LIBESKIND/ ARCHIS No. 3, '89/ \"For a good three years now I have been occupied/ in ridding myself of the stigma of modernity,/ just beacuse in the netherlands it is practised with,/ such indolence.\"/ Rem Koolhaas/ ARCHIS No. 1, '93/ \"Visions of genius are part of social climate.  What/ I don't like is for these references to be derived,/ so that a Picasso is regarded as having sprung from \"Nothing\".\"/ Hermann Pitz/ ARCHIS No. 1, '93/ \"At the present time, we architects have ideals/ which are held in check by irony.  Irony is a/ moderate emotion, it isn't satire, it isn't coarse,/ it's laughing at yourself a bit.  But that laughter/ is very serious.\"/ Denise Scott Brown/ ARCHIS No. 11, '92/ \"Let us at least bear witness, time and time again,/ and for no-one, to thought as a catastrophe, as/ nomadism, as disparity and unemployment./  If we cannot make engravings, let us at least do/ our graffiti.\"/ Jean-Francois Lyotard. \"  Three rows of dots in quotes.  Imprinted at right over three squares: \"YOUR NAME HERE\" (in white)/ ARCHIS (in black, across bottom)/ THE DUTCH OUTLOOK ON ARCHITECTURE\" (in white).  Geometric shapes and lines at bottom.",
