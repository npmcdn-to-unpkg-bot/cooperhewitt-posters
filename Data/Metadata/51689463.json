In seeking to provide a visual identity that responded to the theater’s mission as an accessible community theater, Scher drew inspiration from the streets of New York City to create a series of graphics that responded to both the grid-structure of the streets and the urban language of graffiti. \nThe posters that Scher designed for The Public Theater have become iconic emblems—not only of the plays that they advertised, but of the cultural moments in which they were produced. Scher’s designs reference the pervasive social, economic and political issues of the time. The museum is perpetually interested in adding the work of National Design Award winners to the permanent collection.",
