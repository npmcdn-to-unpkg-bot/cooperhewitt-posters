        "gallery_text": "Designed for the Architectural League of New York , Hypotheses (1988) is a poster that mixes typography with components of architectural drawings. Michael Bierut, one of America’s premier graphic designers for the last five decades, expertly and precisely lays text on a grid. Mimicking a blueprint, the thin, faint type is combined with line against the deep blue hue of the poster’s background, rendering the poster somewhat illegible (the viewer must examine the announcement closely to discern its message). Although made while Bierut was working at Vignelli Associates at the start of his career, Beirut’s desire to become a graphic designer was apparent much earlier on. Bierut was fifteen-years-old when he discovered the field had a name after he came upon a book about getting commercial work by the graphic designer S. Neil Fujita (1921–2010) in his school library.  Now a partner at the award-winning firm Pentagram, Bierut continues to shape current graphic design discourse.",
