The word \"Volvo\" in large white block letters in at upper center and at the lower center of the sheet are three columns of descriptive text.",

This is why Volvo / decided to submit a very realistic proposal for / future city taxi development. / The Volvo taxi is spacious inside despite / compact outer dimensions. It is about 1 1/2 feet / shorter than today's taxi, six inches narrower / and more than a foot higher. Curb weight is / only 34 feet due to the short overhang.\n\nLower center[second column of text]: Body construction is based on Volvo's \"safety / cage\" principles. A framework of immensly / strong girders surrounds the occupant area and / there are impact protectors on the doors.  Energy-absorbing front and rear body sections / are designed to crumple at a controlled rate, / absorbing the collision force. / The heart of the heating/ventilation/air / conditioning system, along with the controls, is / positioned to the driver's right. Two condenser / fans are built into the roof. / The aerodynamic roof line features vents / which direct air behind the recessed, vertical / rear windows, keeping it clear in all weather.\n\nLower right[third column of text]:Powering the VOlvo taxi is a six-cylinder diesel / engin featuring swirl combustion chambers. / Output is 70mph at 4500 rpm for a top speed / of 85 mph. A turbocharger can be fitted to / further increase horsepower. Either version / gives ample accleration for city traffic / conditions. / The quiet, smooth running automatic / transmission has no direct ties between the / engine and final drive. At its rear is a unique drop gear driving a forward pointing propshaft.",
