The International Center for Design New York (IDCNY) hired the studio to create material to promote its series of seminars on “the business of design,” which gives this poster its title. Vignelli viewed graphic design as a way of organizing information,  so the hierarchy of type, with respect to size and weight of the letterforms, is clearly delimited. He was also known to use only a handful of clean and modern typefaces on any given project, upholding his idea that typefaces should be objective; for Vignelli, the role of typography was to effectively communicate the concept of a work.  In The Business of Design, created in 1988, the layout is organized on a grid, as is customary with Vignelli’s printed matter, and the graphic dollar sign is a composition of lines, angles, and shading, making the image appear to recede into the page.",
