The Kamerny Theater was a pioneer in eclectic and modernist productions. For each production, Tairov invited new artists who were innovative in their aesthetic approach to create new designs for the stage, costumes, as well as the production’s promotional material. \nOne of the most brilliant designers associated with the Kamerny was Alexandra Exter. At the time of proposed acquisition, Cooper-Hewitt has one costume design by Exter in the collection, Costume for a Boyard (1981-37-18), which was likely created for either the Kamerny Theater or the Moscow Art Theater.",
