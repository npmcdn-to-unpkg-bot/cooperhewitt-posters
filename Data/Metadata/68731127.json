(In 2013, the organization changed its name to Bureau Europa).  In 2011, They were asked to design the promotional materials for the exhibition “Alison & Peter Smithson: The Art of Inhabitation.”  For the exhibition identity, the designers chose to reference the influential 1956 exhibition “This is Tomorrow,” which was held at Whitechapel Gallery in London and had included work by the Smithsons.  The catalogue for “This is Tomorrow,” designed by Edward Wright (British, 1912–88), had featured a floor plan at each chapter break.  Experimental Jetset’s design featured a four-room floor plan.  In each “room” the designers place one word of the exhibition’s subtitle.  The layout of the floor plan, with its doorways, entrances, and exists, guides the reader as to how to read the text, “The Art of Inhabitation.”  But the designers appreciated that the layout allowed for the viewers to see the echoes of an alternate reading, “The Inhabitation of Art.”  The poster, screenprinted by Wyber Zeefdruk, was used to advertise the exhibition outdoors throughout the city.",
