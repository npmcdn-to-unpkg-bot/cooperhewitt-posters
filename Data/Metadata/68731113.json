The exhibition looked at influence of Playboy Magazine on architecture and design, and was curated by the M+M (Media and Modernity) Program at the Princeton University School of Architecture.  Experimental Jetset took the iconic bunny logo of Playboy and cropped and rotated it, creating a “multi-eyed entity” that alluded to the exhibitions themes.  The designers chose to print some of the text in pink, a reference to the “notion of flesh,” but also “an attempt to somewhat undermine the ‘machismo’ of the subject of the exhibition.  After all,” the designers have noted, “pink is often seen as an effeminate colour.”  The design was altered to suit three different formats: a large, poster screenprinted by Wyber Zeefdruk was used to advertise the exhibition outdoors.  A smaller poster, offset-printed by Lenoirschuring, advertised the exhibition indoors.  A folder pamphlet served as an invitation.",
