Like all dreams / the details were obscure.  But one thing / was certain: St. Peter's Church, which / had stood on the corner of 54th Street and / Lexington for over 70 years, / would have a new home on that same / corner. /\n2nd paragraph in white: Facing the Lexington Avenue side of Citibank's building at 399 Park Avenue, excavation of Citicorp Center's site was / begun in April, 1974.  To reach sound rock / on which the main tower is to stand, it / was necessary in some areas to dig down / fifty feet below grade.  Though completion / is not scheduled before early 1977, con- / struction is already transforming the char- / acter of the block bounded by Lexington / and Third Avenues and 53rd and 54th Streets, as well as the surrounding area.",
