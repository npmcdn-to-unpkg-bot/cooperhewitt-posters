So it is with Citicorp Center, the / single most important project now under / construction in the city, which will revital- /ize the area surrounding it by creating a / dynamic new business and cultural center / on the east side of midtown Manhattan. / \nArchitect Hugh Stubbins' unique design / of the main tower building makes / possible the mixing of Citicorp Center's diverse parts: three buildings, including / St. Peter's Church, and two pedestrian / areas. The main tower will be the third / tallest building in midtown, fifth tallest in New York City, and, upon completion, will / become a landmark like the Chrysler and / Empire State buildings south of it.",
