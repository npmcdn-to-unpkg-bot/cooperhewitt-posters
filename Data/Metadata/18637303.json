The postural and vascular problems that are the result of this sedentary working life can be partially combated by choosing an ergonomically designed chair that permits / adjustment and frequent changes of posture. However, medical research has shown that no seated position is good when maintained for long periods of time. These exercises can be performed while seated and will help stimulate circulation and regenerate muscular elasticity. \n\nNine diagrams of figure--outline of figure in orange, red, and yellow--exercising in chair accompanied by instructions imprinted in white ink: Occasionally elevate your legs horizontally to the thighs. / Flex, stretch, and move your body while vigorously using the chair’s rocking motion. / Lift your knees and angle them toward your body. / Pump your feet to increase the blood flow from the legs to the trunk. / Elongate your torso and raise your arms in a full stretch position. / Contract your calf muscles by moving your feet back and forth while sitting. / Tiptoe while seated, using the chair’s rocking motion. / Rotate your head and tilt forward and backward to exercise your neck vertebrae. / If your work requires you to sit for uninterrupted periods of more than thirty minutes, get up / and stand – or even better, walk around – for a few minutes.",
