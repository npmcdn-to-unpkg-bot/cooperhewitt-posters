        "justification": "In this poster by Marian Bantjes, the influence of The Grammar of Ornament by Owen Jones is evident, as are more direct sources such as Islamic writing and arabesque ornament. The text refers to the many influences that have shaped Bantjesâ€™s design aesthetic, including gothic lettering, Arts and Crafts, rococo, baroque, art nouveau, psychedelia, and dimensional typography. The complexity of her personality comes together here in a unique and experimental way. \nA trend in contemporary design is the reexamination of the use of ornament as a counterpoint to the traditional clarity of the grid. Bantjes mines the history of calligraphy, type design, ornament, and oriental symbols and enlivens their compositions. Self-consciously autobiographical in tone, Bantjes' elaborate samplings of images, flourishes, and fonts take graphic design in a fresh new direction.",
