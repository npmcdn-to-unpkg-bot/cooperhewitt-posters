His work in sculpture and installation features fluorescent tubes and incandescent bulbs, often arranged in patterns that have their origins in the Kamilaroi/Wiradjuri traditions.  His exhibition at Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation, “Untitled (the tyranny of distance)” showcased a piece with fluorescent lights enclosed in blue tarpaulin.  For his design, Gowing adopted the colors, light and shade of Jones’ artwork and created a typeface that draws on the angular lines of the fluorescent tubes, while referencing early experiments in Soviet Constructivist typography.",
