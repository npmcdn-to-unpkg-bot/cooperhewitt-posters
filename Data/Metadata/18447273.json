        "gallery_text": "American-born E. McKnight Kauffer traveled to England in the mid-1910s, where he settled and became a successful commercial artist. His work elevated poster design to that of a fine art, using sophisticated styles and techniques in celebrated designs for a range of clients, including London Transport. In 1940, at the outbreak of World War II, he moved to New York, where he found work designing for corporate clients and war relief agencies. Between 1946 and 1953, he produced over thirty posters for American Airlines, most of which are represented in the Cooper Hewitt collection. Travel posters should convey \"the character of places, the manners and differences of people, architectural interests and amusements,\" Kauffer wrote. He often focused on the places and their people, rather than the travel itself, as shown in this poster. The street view of a soaring New York skyscraper with its geometric lines and minimal color palette is typical of Kauffer’s work of this period.",
