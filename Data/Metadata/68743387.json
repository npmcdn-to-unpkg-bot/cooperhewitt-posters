He had left China twelve years earlier to study in Berlin, where he eventually founded his design studio Hesign. As He labored over packing his work to ship to Hong Kong, he found himself caught up in thoughts over his initial long journey from China to Europe. The \"backwards\" journey of He’s graphic design pieces struck him as \"one part of [his] circuitous life,\" so He selected the exhibition title \"detour.\" He modified a typeface so that the ends of many of the letters trail-off into meandering lines. Some of the lines curve inward toward the center of the poster, while other lines extend to the edge of the paper.",
